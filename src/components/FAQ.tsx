    question: "What types of files can I upload?",
    answer: "Masterly supports documents (PDF, Word, PowerPoint), images (JPG, PNG), audio files (MP3, M4A), and YouTube links. You can upload materials in any language, and our AI will process them into study-ready content.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are the AI-generated study materials?",
    answer: "We use our Always Worksâ„¢ validation system, which includes multiple AI accuracy checks, content verification, and user feedback loops. Every flashcard, quiz, and summary goes through rigorous validation before reaching you. We maintain a 98% accuracy rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the spaced repetition scheduling work?",
    answer: "We use the proven SM2 algorithm, which schedules flashcard reviews at scientifically optimal intervals based on your performance. Cards you struggle with appear more frequently, while mastered cards are reviewed just before you'd forget them - maximizing retention while minimizing study time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my study data secure and private?",
    answer: "Absolutely. All your uploads and study data are encrypted end-to-end. We never share your personal information or study materials with third parties. Your data is stored securely on enterprise-grade servers and you can delete it anytime from your account settings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Masterly for multiple exams at once?",
    answer: "Yes! Exam Workspaces let you organize study materials by exam type (SAT, ACT, AP, etc.). Each workspace has its own progress tracking, due dates, and countdown timers. You can switch between workspaces seamlessly and study for multiple exams simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after my free trial ends?",
    answer: "After your 1-week free trial (available on monthly and yearly plans), your subscription will automatically renew through the App Store unless you cancel. You can cancel anytime from your App Store subscription settings with no penalties.",
